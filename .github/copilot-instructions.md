# Alternity Warships Generator - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a desktop application for generating Warships for the **Alternity** sci-fi tabletop role-playing game. The app implements the ship construction rules from the "Warships" sourcebook by Richard Baker.

The application guides users through a step-by-step warship building process, similar to a character creation wizard.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) v6
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Desktop**: Electron (with context isolation enabled)
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Architecture Patterns

### Data Flow
- **JSON data files** → **dataLoader.ts** (runtime load) → **Services** (calculate) → **Components** (display)
- Data files are loaded at app startup via Electron IPC, allowing users to edit them externally
- State is managed in `App.tsx` and passed down to step components
- Save/Load uses Electron IPC for native file dialogs

### Externally Editable Data Files
The game data (hulls, armor, power plants, etc.) is stored in JSON files that can be edited by users:
- In **development**: Files are read from `src/data/`
- In **production**: Files are copied to `resources/data/` alongside the app
- The `dataLoader.ts` service handles loading with fallback to bundled data
- Users can modify these files to add custom hulls, adjust costs, etc.
- Changes require app restart to take effect

### Warship Building Steps (in order)
1. **Hull** - Select ship class and hull type (required)
2. **Armor** - Choose armor weight and type (optional)
3. **Power Plant** - Install power plants for energy (required)
4. **Engines** - Install engines for movement (required, not yet implemented)
5. **FTL Drive** - Faster-than-light capability (optional, not yet implemented)
6. **Systems** - Additional ship systems (optional, not yet implemented)

### Key Concepts from Alternity Warships
- **Hull Points (HP)**: Space available for installations; each component uses HP
- **Power Points (PP)**: Energy generated by power plants; systems consume PP
- **Ship Classes**: small-craft, light, medium, heavy, super-heavy
- **Damage Track**: stun → wound → mortal → critical
- **Toughness Rating**: Determines weapon effectiveness against the ship

## Coding Conventions

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional React components with hooks
- Use MUI components for consistent UI
- Keep calculations in service files, not components
- All game data comes from JSON files in `src/data/`
- Type definitions mirror the Warships rulebook terminology

## UI Conventions

- **Maximize screen usage**: UI should expand to fill all available screen space
- **Tables/Grids**: Should take all the horizontal space they need - avoid wrapping content awkwardly
- **Single horizontal scrollbar**: When content overflows, use ONE horizontal scrollbar at the container level, not multiple nested scrollbars
- **Responsive but desktop-first**: This is an Electron desktop app, so optimize for larger screens

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev:electron    # Run in development mode
npm run build:electron  # Build for production
npm run dist:win        # Create Windows installer
```

## Current State / TODO

### Implemented
- [x] Hull selection with stats display
- [x] Armor selection (weight + type)
- [x] Power plant installation (multiple plants, fuel tanks)
- [x] Save/Load warship to .warship.json files
- [x] Electron menu with keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Externally editable data files (loaded at runtime)

### Not Yet Implemented
- [ ] Engines step
- [ ] FTL Drive step
- [ ] Systems step (weapons, defenses, sensors, etc.)
- [ ] Final summary/export step
- [ ] Validation for minimum requirements

## Reference Material

The `Warships.txt` file in the project root contains the full text of the Alternity Warships sourcebook. Use this as the authoritative reference for:
- Ship construction rules (Chapter 5)
- Hull types and their stats
- Equipment costs and requirements
- Game mechanics and terminology
